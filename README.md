# NonseparableALPforNRM

For every experiment, you have to execute the file "001Main.run" in AMPL. In this file, you can specify the following parameters:
- The parameter "task": task = 1: Solve an ALP and simulate the policy for a manually chosen partition; task = 2: Determine the partition for which the network measure is largest, which can then be used for NSEP^(I/q,q); task = 3: Determine the subset for which the network measure is largest, which can then be used for NSEP^(1,q)AL; task = 4: Solve ALP and simulate the policy for all partitions, the result is printed to a .txt-file.
- The parameter "datatype":
